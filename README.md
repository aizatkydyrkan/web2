# Assignment 2 – Backend API Integration & Service Development

## Project Overview
This project is a backend-based web application that retrieves and displays real-time weather data using external APIs.  
All third-party API communication is handled strictly on the **server side**, following best backend security practices.

The application fetches weather data from the **OpenWeather API** and displays it to the user through a simple and responsive interface.
